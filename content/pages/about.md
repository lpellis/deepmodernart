## Overview

### What is Deep Dream
DeepDream is a computer vision program created by Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia, thus creating a dream-like hallucinogenic appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.

## Frequiently asked questions

### What are the image license
The base images are all from artworks that are in the public domain.  You can use the generated images under the creative commons license,
or generate your own.

### Can I make images like these myself
Yes, there are many tools availible, like https://deepdreamgenerator.com/ or https://aiartists.org/ai-ethic

### The artist likely intended some  meaning to the artwork, is that not lost when combined with the deep style / deep dream process?

Probably
